# glmSlope - SLOPE for generalized linear models

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dkucharc/glmSlope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dkucharc/glmSlope)

### Instalation guide
Currently the package is under heavy development. Therefore, it is recommended to install the package directly from the Github repository. This can achieved by using an `install_github` function provided by the `devtools` package. Namely,
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("dkucharc/glmSlope")
```
